This is the first entry in my ongoing learning journal. I am creating this blog to track my personal progress as I continue to upgrade my technical skills. My career has sidetracked away from Computing Science and Development and now I need to update my technical skills to stay relevent. I was also looking for a medium to improve my writting and documentation skills. 

Since Git is now the defacto standard for software version control, I decided to start there.  Previously, I've had experience with version control systems such as CVS, StarTeam and SubVersion.  Learning Git almost immediately had me learning about GitHub and remote repositories. Quickly I also learned about branches, cloning, pull requests and so on.  

I was also very intrigued by the concept of GitHub pages and the possibility of free website hosting. I had been wanting to create a better online presence including a resume and portfolio and because GitHub tracks all of your work and projects anyways this felt like a natural fit.  This discovery then led to Jekyll, Markdown and creating beautiful static websites.

After setting up my environment including WSL, Ubuntu, Ruby and VSCode; I was able to create a Jekyll site, apply a theme and push it up to GitHub.  Shortly after I was able to create a website template and apply a theme as well as route DNS entries to the page.  I can now create a brand new good looking website in less than 5 mins and while some may argue that you can also do that with WordPress, I prefer the simplicity and elegance of static pages on GitHub. 

Now to improve the capabilities of my Jekyll sites, I went through the [Jekyll Video Walkthroughs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) provided by Mike and [Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/c/GiraffeAcademy). This has provided me with a great introduction to Jekyll that will provide the basis for any future static website I wish to make.
